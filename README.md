# NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction

One of my first hands-on experience with Data, I have performed EDA on the dataset.

Then I have tried fitting a linear model to my data, tried doing feature selection, performed Lasso and Ridge regression.
Now, I have performed a KNN Regression on my dataset which definitely performed better than Linear Regression. 

As I learn new modelling techniques, I will apply and hopefully, find the perfect model for our dataset.
